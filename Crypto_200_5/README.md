# Crypto_200_5
Decode the QR-Code and Bar-Code and find them encrypted by some classic cipher. I try caesar cipher at http://rumkin.com/tools/cipher/caesar.php  
The message is that Bob asks Alice for flag, and Alice gives it to Bob.  
I didn't save either the image or the message at the time because all the operations are at my browser..
